Some lua-scripting to push ds18b20-temperature to graphite

# 3D Printing
I wanted to have a proper modularisation of all the parts. Therefore i created
with the help of tincercad [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3bous545sHx)
a kind of socket to be able to screw the parts on it.
All the files can be find on Tinkercad but also in the 3d-printing folder.

Here are some photos:
