# luatemp2graphite
Some lua-scripting to push ds18b20-temperature to graphite.
If you don't have a graphite available, easily boot one on [docker-cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/)
with this [docker-compose-file](https://github.com/k9ert/docker-weather-carbon-feeder/blob/master/docker-cloud.yml).

# 3D Printing
I wanted to have a proper modularisation of all the parts. Therefore i created
with the help of tincercad [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3bous545sHx)
a kind of socket to be able to screw the parts on it.
All the files can be find on Tinkercad but also in the 3d-printing folder.

Here are some photos:
